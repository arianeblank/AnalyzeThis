chmod +x analyze_this.py

Currently supports Gene Enrichment Analysis via GSEA


Analyze a list of genes

1) as inputs, it'll take  list(s) of enriched genes in some format
	CSV
2) which analysis program would you like to use?
3) what data sets would you like to check your results against?
4) as outputs, it'll take path(s) to write the outputs to
	and the formats to write them in

ask() ==> implies that there are no side effects - no other impacts to running this computation besides the output of the computation itself

for example:
   if my function ask() makes a speaker blare music, that's a 'side effect' of the function
   even if my function returns the same answer regardless
