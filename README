Just ./analyze_this.py, and answer the questions! If it says this is unsupported,
chmod +x analyze_this.py

Currently supports Gene Enrichment Analysis via GSEA


Analyze a list of genes

1) as inputs, it'll take  list(s) of enriched genes in some format
	CSV
2) which analysis program would you like to use?
3) what data sets would you like to check your results against?
4) as outputs, it'll take path(s) to write the outputs to
	and the formats to write them in

ask() ==> implies that there are no side effects - no other impacts to running this computation besides the output of the computation itself

for example:
   if my function ask() makes a speaker blare music, that's a 'side effect' of the function
   even if my function returns the same answer regardless


TODO
--------
Kian - provide a ./setup script that automatically asks which kinds of analyses they'd like to be running, and then downloads and installs each of the associated programs that will be required before continuing
Ariane - figure out which tools we want to run for gsea by manually running it on the dataset hiding in test/data/gene_enrichment_test.csv

For GSEA, it will look something like:
java -cp build/gsea-3.0.jar -Xmx1024m gsea-tool parameters

gsea-tool and parameters are probably going to be variable - the rest should be verbatim

GSEA COMMANDS:
java -cp build/gsea-3.0.jar -Xmx1024m gsea-tool parameters

for panther you'll need to figure it out - google run panther from command line
